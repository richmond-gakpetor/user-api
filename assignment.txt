You have been required to create a basic express server from scratch 
that would be receive requests and send responses.

Below are the requests it should handle and responses it should send. 
Request - POST request to add new user (first_name, last_name, date_of_birth, school). 
Response - Send a JSON response with message, 'User has been created'. 

Request - GET request to get all users. 
Response - Send a JSON response with users (return just 3 users). 

Create a GitHub repository, push your code to the repository and submit the GitHub url. 

NB: Please make sure the repository you created is public, with a readme file and a description.
